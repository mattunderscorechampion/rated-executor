/**
 * A base implementation for a {@link Future}.
 * <P>
 * This provides some support for cancellation, checking that the task is done, getting and setting
 * the result. It ensures that completed tasks cannot be cancelled. It makes sure that cancelled
 * tasks are treated as done. It helps with the setting of the result. It ensures that
 * {@link #get()} and {@link #get(long, TimeUnit)} throw the correct exceptions. Hooks are provided
 * to access the result, block until the result is set to determine if the task is done and to
 * perform the cancellation.
 * <P>
 * This is also a {@link ITaskWrapper} because the task, executor and the future are tightly
 * coupled. The task must be executed and the result passed to the future, cancellation is passed
 * from the future to the executor and the task. After the executor runs the task it must set the
 * {@link Future} result.
